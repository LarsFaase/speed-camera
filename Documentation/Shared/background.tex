Joan Schrasser lives on a road with a 30 km/h speed limit. However, most drivers do not follow this, and so dangerous situation arise.
Children have to cross the road to go to school, and there is a bicycle lane right next to this road.
Accidents have already happened, but the municipality and local polic point at each other and don't want to do anything about it.

To show the severity of this situation, a hidden speed camera should be designed and built, so that the data can be shown to the police.
