This document is written to provide the research required to build a hidden speed camera.
The question that this research paper will try to answer is: "How can we make a speed camera that logs the speed and number plate of road users?"
To answer this research question there needs to be research to several topics such as ALPR (Automatic License Plate Recognition) and ways to detect the speed of vehicles.

\section{Background and context}

Joan Schrasser lives on a road with a 30km/h speed limit. However, most drivers do not follow this, and so dangerous situation arise.
Children have to cross the road to go to school, and there is a bicycle lane right next to this road.
Accidents have already happened, but the municipality and local polic point at each other and don't want to do anything about it.
\cite{avans:assignment}

To show the severity of this situation, a hidden speed camera should be designed and built, so that the data can be shown to the police.
