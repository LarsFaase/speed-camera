This document is written to provide the research required to build a hidden speed camera.
The question that this research paper will try to answer is: "How can we make a speed camera that logs the speed and number plate of road users?"
To answer this research question there needs to be research to several topics such as ALPR (Automatic License Plate Recognition) and ways to detect the speed of vehicles.
